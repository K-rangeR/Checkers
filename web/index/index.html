        <p id="howToPlay">
            When playing, select one of your checkers
            by clicking on it with your mouse. The selected checker will turn
            orange. Next you can press the square you want to move that checker
            to. If the move was valid your turn is over and it is your opponents
            turn. If the move was not valid the game will let you know and you will
            be asked to try again. To jump over and eliminate the other players checker
            start by selecting one of your checkers that you want to move, then select
            one of the opponents checkers you want to jump, their checker will
            turn red indicating that its jumpable. Finally press the destination
            square that you want to jump to. If you want to select a different checker
            simply press the new checker you want to move, its color will change
            to orange and the old checker will go back to the normal color. Once a
            checker makes it to the other side of the board it becomes a king, every
            king checker will have a black ring around it. King checkers can move
            forward and backward on the board.
